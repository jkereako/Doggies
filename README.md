# Doggies
This is a small project for me to learn Xamarin. It provides an example for how
to:

* Download JSON data asynchronously,
* Deserialize it into a contract object,
* Convert that contract into a view model, and then
* Present the data in a ListView.

This is a work in progress. I plan to continue to work on it the more I learn.
